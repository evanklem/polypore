  Single entry-point orchestrator for the PolyFlow loop. The user says "let's polyflow this", "use polyflow", "polyflow this idea", "run this through polyflow", "implement with polyflow", or any similar phrasing — and you walk the loop (brainstorm → plan → execute → tdd → iterate → STOP) end-to-end, announcing each step, respecting checkpoints, and stopping where the user retains control. Trigger keywords: "polyflow", "let's polyflow", "use polyflow", "polyflow this".

# PolyFlow: Go (Entry-Point Orchestrator)

Single entry point for the PolyFlow workflow. The user gives you an idea or task and asks to "polyflow it" — you take responsibility for walking the whole loop end-to-end, picking the right sub-skill at each step, and respecting checkpoints where the user must stay in control.

You are the conductor; the other `polyflow-*` skills are the orchestra.

## Vocabulary

See `polyflow` meta-skill for the shared vocabulary (deep modules, deletion test, vertical slice, grill, mockup quick-mode).

## When to Use

Trigger phrases (or anything semantically equivalent):
- "let's polyflow this"
- "use polyflow"
- "polyflow this idea"
- "run this through polyflow"
- "implement with polyflow"
- "let's [do X] using polyflow"

**SKIP when:**
- The user is asking a factual question (no skill needed at all)
- The user wants quick mockups only (the brainstorming skill's mockup quick-mode handles this directly — no full loop needed)
- The user explicitly invoked a specific sub-skill by name (`polyflow-debug`, etc.) — let them control granularly
- The work is a one-line fix or trivial change — full loop is overkill

## The Walk

### Phase 0 — Restate and Confirm Scope (one sentence)

Confirm you've understood the idea in your own words, in one sentence. Examples:
> "Got it — you want to add an `archived` flag to messages so cancelled ones drop off the dashboard."

Then ask one calibration question if scope isn't obvious:
> "Quick scope check: is this a small targeted change or a feature with multiple components?"

If the user signals quick/small → consider whether a full polyflow loop is overkill. Offer a shortcut: "This sounds small — want me to skip brainstorming/planning and just TDD it directly? Or run the full loop anyway?"

### Phase 1 — Brainstorm (always, unless user opts out)

**Announce:** "Step 1: brainstorming via `polyflow-brainstorming`."

Invoke `polyflow-brainstorming`:
- Quick context check (skim relevant files; don't exhaustively explore)
- Scope check (decompose if multi-subsystem)
- Clarifying questions one at a time, multiple-choice when possible
- Propose 2–3 approaches with your recommendation as option (a)
- Embedded grill on the chosen approach
- Present the design in sections; get explicit approval

**Mockup quick-mode bypass:** if the user originally said "show me mockups" rather than "implement," skip the full loop and produce mockups directly (HTML files, Figma frames, ASCII layouts — whatever the project uses). No spec, no plan, no TDD ceremony.

**Checkpoint:** before continuing, the user must explicitly approve the design. Not a tacit yes — actual confirmation.

### Phase 2 — Plan (if non-trivial)

**Announce:** "Step 2: writing the plan via `polyflow-writing-plans`."

If scope is small (one file, one behavior change), skip to Phase 3 with a verbal plan ("I'll write a failing test for X, then minimal impl"). Otherwise:

Invoke `polyflow-writing-plans`:
- File structure first (name files + responsibilities, deletion test on each)
- Embedded grill on the structure
- Bite-sized tasks

**Checkpoint:** before continuing, the user must approve the plan.

### Phase 3 — Execute

**Announce:** "Step 3: executing the plan via `polyflow-executing-plans`."

Invoke `polyflow-executing-plans`:
- Critical review of plan
- Set up TaskCreate items
- Task-by-task; each task uses `polyflow-tdd` for any production code
- Inline verification (typecheck, lint, test for affected workspaces)
- Stop and ask on blockers

Every code-writing task goes through `polyflow-tdd` — it's the discipline running inside the execute harness, not a phase that comes after. Per-cycle: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (refactor with the fresh test as safety net, not deferred to the end). Behavior through public interface, watch each test fail before writing impl, assertion correctness check.

### Phase 4 — Iterate (always, on success)

**Announce:** "Step 4: self-review loop via `polyflow-iterate`."

Invoke `polyflow-iterate`:
- Run the project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test — exact commands per CLAUDE.md)
- Re-read the diff (dead code, naming, deletion test, magic strings, error handling, type safety, security, test coverage, assertion correctness, scope creep, comments)
- Five Failure Modes pass (hallucinated actions, scope creep, cascading errors, context loss, tool misuse)
- For UI changes: chromium screenshot via `chromium --headless --screenshot=...`, then read the PNG
- Fix what's found, restart loop
- Hard cap of 5 iterations

### Phase 5 — STOP

**Announce:** "Implementation complete. Stopping here per PolyFlow's no-auto-finish rule."

Report:
- What was built (file list, one-line each)
- What behaviors were added/changed
- What verifications passed
- Any deferred items (with reason)
- Anything the user should review before deciding next steps

**Do NOT** stage files, commit, push, merge, or open a PR. **Wait for user direction.**

## Cross-Cutting: Context Compaction

Watch for drift symptoms throughout (re-asking established questions, contradicting earlier decisions, restating constraints already set). At any clean phase boundary (after design approval, after plan approval, after execution success), if the session feels heavy, **proactively offer**:

> "We just finished [phase X]. Context is getting heavy — want me to invoke `polyflow-compact` to summarize anchors and prep for `/clear` before the next phase?"

Don't force it. Let the user decide.

## Hard Rules (inherited from `polyflow` meta + this skill's specifics)

- **Never auto-commit, never auto-stage, never auto-finish.** Phase 5 is `STOP`. The user controls integration.
- **Never invent values.** File paths, env vars, IDs, function names, library APIs — if unsure, STOP and ask. Action-hallucination is the top failure mode.
- **Respect checkpoints.** After brainstorming and after planning, get explicit user approval before continuing. Not a tacit yes.
- **Announce each phase.** "Step N: [skill name] for [purpose]." This keeps the user oriented and able to interrupt cleanly.
- **Don't mix up paths.** If sequential was picked, don't switch to parallel mid-flight. If parallel, don't fall back to sequential silently. Surface the proposed switch and ask.
- **Iterate has a hard cap.** 5 iterations. If still finding issues at iteration 5, the original plan was wrong — stop and ask.

## Hand-offs

This skill IS the entry point. It hands off TO other polyflow skills, not the other way around. The only "hand-off" out of polyflow-go is **STOP** at Phase 5, returning control to the user.

Special-purpose skills can be invoked mid-flow when relevant:
- New domain term emerged → invoke `polyflow-glossary` to update `CONTEXT.md`, then continue
- Design surfaces architecture concerns → invoke `polyflow-improve-architecture` first, then resume
- Interface shape is the hard part → `polyflow-design-interface` before plan
- Bug discovered mid-execution → `polyflow-debug`
- Substantial-feature scope reveals itself → upgrade brainstorming → `polyflow-prd` → writing-plans

These don't break the flow — they're sub-tools used inside the appropriate phase.

## Why This Exists

Without an entry-point orchestrator, the user has to know which `polyflow-*` skill to invoke at each step. That defeats the cohesion property. With `polyflow-go`, the user says "polyflow this" once and the right sub-skill fires at the right time, with the right checkpoints preserved.

The skill is **conductor, not autopilot.** Checkpoints are real (brainstorm approval, plan approval, iterate hand-back). The user always has the option to interrupt, switch paths, or take manual control.
