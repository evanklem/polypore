# PolyFlow: TDD




## Vocabulary

See `polyflow` meta-skill. Key terms: **vertical slice**, **behavior through public interface**, **deep module**.

## Core Principle

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't break unless behavior changes.

**Good test:** "user can perform action X within their weekly rate limit" — describes capability.

**Bad test:** "calls `createX()` with status `'QUEUED'` then queues a job" — describes mechanics. Renames break it.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT** write all tests first then all implementation. That produces tests of *imagined* behavior, not *actual* behavior. They become insensitive to real changes.

**DO** vertical slices: one test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle.

## Context resets at cycle boundaries

Each RED → GREEN → REFACTOR is one cycle. Reset *cycle-scoped* context (the failing test output, the speculative implementations you tried) at the end of every cycle — keep *task-scoped* context (the public interface, the invariant you're proving, the file you're editing). Long-running TDD sessions drift when early design context falls out and recent debugging noise dominates. Invoke `polyflow-compact` between cycles when context feels heavy.

**Rule of thumb:** if you find yourself re-reading the same file three cycles in a row to remember what changed, the context is dirty. Compact.

## When to Use

- Any production code change (new feature, bug fix, behavior change, refactor with behavior implications)
- All new code in your backend's routers and services
- All new code in your frontend that has testable logic (not pure-presentation components)

## When to Skip (with explicit user approval)

- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code (e.g., `database.types.ts`)
- Configuration files
- Pure-presentation React components with no logic

## The Flow

### 1. Embedded Grill — "What to Test"

Before writing any test, confirm with the user:

- "Which behaviors matter most? We can't test everything."
- "What's the public interface — what will callers actually use?"
- "Are there opportunities to make this a deep module (small interface, complex internals)?"
- "Where do tests need to integrate with real services (DB, payment provider, email provider) vs. where can we test in isolation?"

**Anti-tailoring check (vertical slicing's biggest risk):** before each new test, ask:

- "Am I pinning *behavior the spec/contract names*, or am I pinning *the impl I've already imagined*?"
- "Could I write this next test knowing only the public contract, before reading any of the impl I just wrote?"
- "If a different impl satisfied the same contract, would this test still pass?"

If the test only makes sense given your specific impl, it's an internals test wearing a behavior costume. Rewrite it against the contract, or drop it.

**Default to integration-style tests against real services** (real DB, real queue, real cache) where feasible. Mocked dependencies frequently mask divergence between test and production behavior. Document any project-specific exception in your CLAUDE.md.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test for ONE behavior end-to-end. Prove the path works.

```
RED:      Write test → run → confirm it fails for the RIGHT reason
GREEN:    Write minimal code → run → confirm it passes
REFACTOR: Clean the impl + the test you just wrote, while it's fresh and green
```

The REFACTOR step is non-optional and **per-cycle** — it happens with the test you just wrote as your safety net, not after all tests are done. Refactoring cold code days later is a different (weaker) activity; that lives in `polyflow-iterate`.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior, repeat the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

```
RED:      Write next test → fails for the right reason
GREEN:    Minimal code to pass → passes
REFACTOR: Clean before moving on (see checklist below)
```

Rules:
- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass the current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Tests focus on observable behavior, not internals
- **Never skip REFACTOR.** "I'll clean it up later" is how dead code, duplication, and shallow modules accumulate.

### 4. Per-Cycle Refactor Checklist

After each GREEN, before writing the next failing test, scan the just-touched code:

- **Duplication** — extract if used twice with the same intent (not just structurally similar)
- **Naming** — does the new name match what the code does? Rename now, while the test pins behavior
- **Deletion test** — does the new module/function earn its existence, or did GREEN add bloat?
- **Deep-module check** — small interface hiding the complexity, or shallow wrapper leaking it?
- **Test cleanliness** — does the test still describe behavior crisply? Names, setup, assertion all clear?

Run tests after each refactor step. **Never refactor while RED** — get to GREEN first.

If a refactor would change behavior, stop: that's a new test, not a refactor.

### 5. Macro Refactor (deferred to `polyflow-iterate`)

Cross-cutting refactors that span the whole feature (extracting a shared module across multiple cycles, pulling out a deeper abstraction, restructuring the file layout) belong in `polyflow-iterate`'s self-review pass — *after* all per-cycle refactors are done. Don't conflate the two: per-cycle refactor uses a fresh test as safety net; macro refactor uses the whole test suite.

## Per-Cycle Checklist

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive an internal refactor (rename, restructure)
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
[ ] Test fails for the right reason before code is written
[ ] ASSERTION IS CORRECT — see warning below
```

## ⚠️ Assertion-Correctness Warning

**Industry research (HumanEval evaluation across four LLMs) found that over 62% of LLM-generated test assertions were incorrect.** This is the single most likely failure mode in LLM-driven TDD: the test passes, but it's testing the wrong thing.

Before writing any test assertion, verify:

- **Does this assertion match what the user actually wants?** Don't assert on behavior you imagined — assert on behavior the spec/contract names.
- **Is this the assertion's most-precise form?** "result is truthy" is weaker than "result equals 42". Loose assertions catch wrong things and miss right things.
- **Would this assertion still pass if the code was subtly wrong?** Mentally introduce a one-character bug — does the assertion catch it? If not, the assertion is too weak.
- **Are you asserting on the right field?** A common failure: asserting `response.status` when the meaningful field is `response.body.error`.
- **For computed values: did you compute the expected value correctly?** Don't trust your own arithmetic — verify by hand or another path.

When in doubt about what to assert, **STOP and ask the user** rather than guess. An asserted-on-the-wrong-thing test is worse than no test — it provides false confidence.

## Hard Rules

- **Vertical slices only.** Never write all tests first.
- **REFACTOR is per-cycle, not deferred.** Every GREEN is followed by a refactor pass on the just-written code, with the fresh test as safety net. Deferring all refactor to the end strips the safety net and is the most common way TDD-shaped code ends up with TDD-shaped scars.
- **Test behavior, not internals.** If a rename breaks a test but behavior didn't change, the test was wrong.
- **Watch the test fail.** If you didn't see RED, you don't know it tests the right thing.
- **Never auto-commit.** TDD cycle is RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, not RED-GREEN-REFACTOR-COMMIT.
- **Default to real services for integration tests.** Mocked databases routinely diverge from production behavior — prefer a test DB unless your project documents a specific exception.

## Hand-offs

- Tests + impl complete for the task → return to `polyflow-executing-plans` to mark task done
- Discovered the interface is wrong → `polyflow-design-interface` to redesign
- Discovered deeper architectural issue → `polyflow-improve-architecture`
